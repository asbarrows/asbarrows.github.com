# About Me

I graduated from Ryerson University with a BSc (Hons) in Medical Physics and am working towards a certificate in Human Resources with a focus on Diversity and Inclusion in the workplace. I am currently the Departmental Assistant at the Faculty of Science at Ryerson University, where I focus part of my work on managing multiple resources on Equity, Diversity, and Inclusivity (EDI) in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). I have coordinated multiple events focused on advancing EDI in science, and was invited alongside Dr. Imogen Coe to talk about the lack of diversity in STEM on CBC's On the Money. I was also the founding president of the Ryerson Science Society, and was a competitive figure skater.
